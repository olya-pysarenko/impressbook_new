A virtual collection of impressions and memories

This project has a training and soulful meaning for me. At first this is a part of my knowledge, capabilities and experience, at second - all my life consists of different impressions. 
This idea and design belongs to great man, developer and UI designer David Drygin. Thank u, David, for all.
